# base

> Fully-featured JavaScript framework written entirely in ES6 (ES2015).

This library is a work in progress and primarily for learning purposes. As always, you're free to use my code as you like, it is my intention to accompany every new module with unit tests and every push to GitHub should be non-breaking. However, there is no plan to have an official release or API documentation, so please use at your own risk.
